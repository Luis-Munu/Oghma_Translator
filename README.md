# Oghma Translation Assistant
## Overview

The Oghma Translation Assistant is a powerful tool designed to help translate the comprehensive document "Oghma" into various languages. This project leverages the capabilities of AI models, currently using DeepSeek, to provide efficient and cost-effective translations. The translations are raw and may require further refinement to achieve the desired quality.
Key Features

    Multi-Language Support: Translates Oghma into multiple languages, with a focus on Spanish.

    Cost-Effective: Translating the entire Oghma document costs less than 50 cents.

    Quick Testing: The GitHub repository includes a small version of Oghma for quick tests.

    Fully Translated Spanish Version: A fully translated Spanish version of Oghma is available in the repository.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

    Python 3.10 or higher

    DeepSeek API key

### Installation

    Clone the Repository
    bash
    Copy

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/oghma-translation.git

    Install Dependencies
    bash
    Copy

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Set Up Environment Variables

    Create a .env file in the root directory and add your DeepSeek API key:
    Copy

    MODEL_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key

### Usage

    Run the Translation Script
    bash
    Copy

    python src/main.py

    Specify Language (Optional)

    By default, the translation is set to French (fr). To translate into another supported language (e.g., Spanish), modify the language parameter in src/config.py:
    python
    Copy

    language: str = 'es'  # For Spanish

    File Paths

    Ensure that the file paths in src/config.py are correctly set, especially if you're using Windows. The paths are currently in Windows format.

## Configuration
### Configuration File

The src/config.py file contains all the settings for the translation process, including API keys, file paths, and model parameters. You can customize these settings to suit your needs.

    API Key: Set your DeepSeek API key in the .env file.

    Input and Output Files: Modify the input_file and output_file paths to point to your Oghma Excel files.

    Language Support: The supported languages are listed in supported_languages. You can add more languages as needed.

### Prompts and System Messages

The prompts and system messages used in the translation process are stored in data/prompts.json. You can customize these prompts to improve the quality of the translations.
Notes

    Raw Translations: The translations generated by the model are raw and may require editing to ensure accuracy and context.

    Cost Considerations: While the cost is low, be mindful of the number of requests sent to the API to avoid unexpected charges.
